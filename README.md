# predicting-neurological-status-from-NON-EEG-Signals

In this day and age brimming with stress, it is critical that individuals are aware of their neurological status (physical stress, cognitive stress, emotional stress, and relaxation). However, traditional approaches using electroencephalogram signals are equipment intensive and not practical for day to day monitoring. With the advent of modern smartwatches that come armed with sensors, the metrics of arterial oxygen level (SpO2), Heart rate (HR), body temperature, and acceleration are readily available. We present an analysis of such metrics and their relation to neurological status and propose machine learning models that can be used to predict the neurological status using the aforementioned metrics. To achieve this, we used a database of non-EEG physiological signals from the Quality of Life Laboratory at the University of Texas at Dallas. The experiment is conducted on 20 healthy subjects and the experiment is divided into 7 stages with corresponding neurological strain. The format and structure of the data is provided in Figure 1 below. During the development of our model, a number of tests have been carried out in order to determine the optimal combination of features and classifiers. The results of the Random Forest Classifier model with appropriate features show a satisfactory capability of prediction and explainability of the neurological status of a user at any given point of time with 92% accuracy.
